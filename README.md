# Javascript Day 1 Homework

Write a simple interest calculator for loans (except Bryce, who will write compound). Ask the user for the total amount borrowed, interest rate and number of years.

Also, write a simple 'game' that makes a user guess a number between 1 and 10. If they are incorrect, output if they are high or low. If they are correct, output that they are correct and end the game. 

Put these in their respective javascript files.

### Reading

Read your JavaScript: Definitive Guide chapters 1-3. The latter part of chapter 3 will cover things that we haven't covered in class and has a few tricky parts. Don't worry about getting all of those immediately. 

### Watching

Watch [Douglas Crockford's JavaScript The Good Parts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook) video. It is approximately one hour, but is massively beneficial to understanding JavaScript.

Having a mastery of these will help greatly in this class. This also covers patterns that are undesirable, but which you may find yourself doing. It also further highlights best practices and pitfalls to avoid.
